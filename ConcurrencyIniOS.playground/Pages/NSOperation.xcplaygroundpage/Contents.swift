 ## NSOperation
 
 `NSOperation` is a high-level abstraction that represents _"a unit of work"_. You can use this to wrap some sort of functionality, and then pass this off to be executed concurrently.

import UIKit

//: `tiltShift()` is a function that applies a tilt-shift-like filter to a `UIImage`, and as such it's rather (artificially) slow.

let image = UIImage(named: "dark_road_small.jpg")
duration { 
  let result = tiltShift(image: image)
}

var outputImage: UIImage?

//: You can use the `NSBlockOperation` subclass of `NSOperation` to easily wrap some functionality.

let myFirstOperation = BlockOperation { 
  outputImage = tiltShift(image: image)
}

//: You can then execute this operation with the `start()` method:
myFirstOperation.start()


outputImage


/*:
 Although `NSBlockOperation` has a very low bar for entry, it's not especially flexible. It's more usual to subclass `NSOperation` directly, and specialise it to particular functionality.
 
 When subclassing, create properties for input and output objects, and then override the `main()` method to perform the work.

class TiltShiftOperation: Operation {
  var inputImage: UIImage?
  var outputImage: UIImage?
  
  override func main() {
	outputImage = tiltShift(image: inputImage)
  }
}

let mySecondOperation = TiltShiftOperation()
mySecondOperation.inputImage = image


/*:
 Once you've created an instance of the operation, and set the input value, you can go ahead and call `start()` to kick off the execution.
 
 - note:
 Calling `start()` might seem a little strange, but don't worry - you won't be doing it for long...
